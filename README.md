# Fine-tuning Vision Language Models with TRL

Welcome! This project demonstrates how to fine-tune vision-language models using the TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning) library. The included Jupyter Notebook walks you through the process step by step.

## Features
- Step-by-step notebook for fine-tuning vision-language models
- Uses the TRL library and Hugging Face Transformers
- Easy to follow and modify for your own datasets

## Getting Started
