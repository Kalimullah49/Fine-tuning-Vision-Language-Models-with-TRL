# Fine-tuning Vision Language Models with TRL

Welcome! This project demonstrates how to fine-tune vision-language models using the TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning) library. The included Jupyter Notebook walks you through the process step by step.

## Features
- Step-by-step notebook for fine-tuning vision-language models
- Uses the TRL library and Hugging Face Transformers
- Easy to follow and modify for your own datasets

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kalimullah49/Fine-tuning-Vision-Language-Models-with-TRL.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook vision-language-models-with-transformers.ipynb
   ```
